# System Architecture Overview

**Document**: Brownfield Enhancement Architecture  
**Scope**: GPT Vision Integration & TEST_MODE Elimination  
**Integration Type**: Minimal Disruption Enhancement  

## Integration Philosophy

### Complementary Enhancement Approach

The DataRoom Intelligence enhancement follows a **minimal disruption** philosophy that preserves all existing functionality while adding intelligent visual document processing capabilities.

**Core Principle**: GPT Vision capabilities are **additive**, not replacement
- Existing document processing pipeline remains as reliable fallback
- New capabilities enhance existing functionality without breaking changes  
- Hybrid approach combining strengths of text and visual processing
- Backward compatibility maintained across all user interfaces

## Integration Strategy

### Minimal Disruption Approach

**Preservation Requirements**
- All existing Slack commands continue working identically
- Current session structure remains backward compatible
- Existing error handling patterns maintained and extended
- Railway deployment configuration unchanged
- Zero breaking changes to user workflows

**Enhancement Strategy**
```python
# BEFORE: Simple text extraction
def process_pdf(self, file_path):
    return self._extract_text_cascade(file_path)

# AFTER: Enhanced with selective vision processing  
def process_pdf(self, file_path):
    # Stage 1: Existing text extraction (preserved)
    text_content = self._extract_text_cascade(file_path)
    
    # Stage 2: NEW - Intelligent vision processing
    if self._requires_vision_analysis(file_path):
        visual_content = self._process_with_vision(file_path)
        return self._merge_extractions(text_content, visual_content)
    
    return text_content
```

### Strategic Integration Areas

**Document Processing Enhancement**
- Maintain existing three-tier fallback system (PyPDF2 → pdfplumber → OCR)
- Add intelligent vision processing as fourth tier for visual-rich content
- Implement cost-aware processing decisions based on content analysis
- Preserve all existing extraction capabilities as fallback mechanisms

**AI Analysis Enhancement**
- Extend existing OpenAI GPT-4 integration to include Vision API
