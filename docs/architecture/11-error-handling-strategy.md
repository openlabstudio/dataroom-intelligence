# 11. Error Handling Strategy

## 11.1. General Approach

*   **Error Model:** The application will use standard Python exceptions. We will define a hierarchy of custom exceptions (e.g., `DataroomNotFoundError`, `ParsingError`) that inherit from a base `AppException`.
*   **Error Propagation:** The `core` service layer will be responsible for raising specific exceptions. The `handlers` layer will be responsible for catching all exceptions, logging the full technical details, and sending a user-friendly, formatted error message to Slack. Under no circumstances should a raw stack trace be shown to the end-user.

## 11.2. Logging Standards

*   **Library:** Python's built-in `logging` module.
*   **Format:** Structured JSON. This allows for easy parsing and filtering in a production logging system.
*   **Required Context:** To enable effective debugging, every log entry generated during a user request must include a unique `trace_id` and the `channel_id` from the Slack event.

## 11.3. Error Handling Patterns

*   **External API Errors:**
    *   **Retry Policy:** For transient network errors or temporary service unavailability (e.g., 503 errors from LlamaParse), the application will use a retry mechanism with exponential backoff (as per **NFR5**).
    *   **Fail-Fast:** For permanent errors (e.g., 401 Invalid API Key, 404 Not Found), the application will fail immediately and log a critical error.
*   **Business Logic Errors:**
    *   Custom exceptions will be used to represent known error states (e.g., user tries to `/connect` to a non-existent dataroom).
    *   The handler will catch these specific exceptions and provide a helpful, context-aware message to the user (e.g., "Error: Dataroom 'xyz' not found. Use `/list` to see available datarooms.").
