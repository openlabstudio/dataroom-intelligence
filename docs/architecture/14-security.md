# 14. Security

## 14.1. Input Validation

*   **Validation Library:** `Pydantic` will be used for all data validation.
*   **Validation Location:** All incoming data from Slack commands MUST be validated in the `handlers` layer before being passed to any `core` service. We will operate on a "zero trust" basis for all external input.

## 14.2. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Authentication:** All communication with external APIs (LlamaParse, OpenAI, Google Drive) will be authenticated using API Keys or Service Accounts as defined in the "External APIs" section. Communication with Slack is secured via Slack's token-based system.
*   **Authorization:** For the MVP, the authorization model is simple. Any user who is a member of a Slack channel where the bot is present is authorized to use all of its commands. There are no per-user roles or permissions.

## 14.3. Secrets Management

*   **Development:** Secrets will be managed using local `.env` files, which MUST NOT be committed to version control.
*   **Production:** Secrets will be managed exclusively through the environment variable system provided by our deployment platform (Railway).
*   **Critical Rule:** Secrets (API keys, tokens) MUST NEVER be hardcoded in the source code.

## 14.4. Data Protection

*   **Encryption in Transit:** All communication with external APIs and with the Slack API MUST use HTTPS.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** We will rely on the default filesystem encryption provided by the production deployment platform (Railway) for our persisted data (JSON files, ChromaDB data).
*   **PII Handling:** While we are not explicitly processing PII, all documents loaded into the system must be treated as confidential. The single-tenant architecture is our primary control to ensure data isolation and confidentiality.

## 14.5. Dependency Security

*   **Scanning Tool:** We will use **GitHub's Dependabot** to automatically scan our `requirements.txt` file for known vulnerabilities and recommend updates.
