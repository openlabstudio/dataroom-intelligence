## Architecture Principles

### üéØ **Brownfield Enhancement Philosophy**
- **Minimal Disruption**: Preserve all existing functionality while adding capabilities
- **Additive Integration**: GPT Vision enhances, doesn't replace existing text extraction
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes to current user workflows
- **Configuration Simplification**: Eliminate TEST_MODE complexity across entire codebase

### üõ°Ô∏è **Quality & Reliability**
- **Intelligent Processing**: 60-70% cost reduction through smart page selection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Vision failures fall back to existing text extraction
- **Cost Controls**: Hard limits and monitoring for Vision API usage
- **Security First**: Secure temporary file handling and API integration

### ‚ö° **Performance & Efficiency**
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine text extraction strengths with visual intelligence
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient multi-page document handling
- **Session Enhancement**: Unified data structure for cross-command access
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient image processing with automatic cleanup

## Implementation Readiness

### ‚úÖ **Technical Validation Complete**
- Integration patterns align with existing OpenAI usage
- Component architecture preserves current functionality
- API design maintains backward compatibility
- Infrastructure changes minimal (Railway deployment unchanged)

### ‚úÖ **Business Requirements Alignment**
- All PRD functional requirements architecturally addressed
- Performance targets achievable with defined approach
- Cost optimization strategies provide measurable savings
- Quality improvements quantifiable through enhanced extraction

### ‚úÖ **Risk Mitigation Established**
- Fallback mechanisms prevent service disruption
- Incremental deployment enables safe rollout
- Cost controls prevent budget overruns
- Rollback strategy available at each phase

## Key Technical Decisions

### **GPT Vision Integration Strategy**
- **Selective Processing**: Intelligent page selection reduces costs by 60-70%
- **Hybrid Pipeline**: Combines text + vision for maximum information capture
- **API Optimization**: Image preprocessing for optimal cost/quality balance
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive fallback to text-only processing

### **Architecture Simplification**
- **TEST_MODE Elimination**: Remove 87+ conditional statements across codebase
- **Configuration Streamlining**: Single production-ready configuration model
- **Development Workflow**: Direct production API integration with cost controls
- **Code Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with modular enhancement

### **Session Management Enhancement**
