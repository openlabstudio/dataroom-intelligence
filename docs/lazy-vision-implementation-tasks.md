## RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY

### High-Risk Scenarios & Mitigation

**Risk**: Strategic page selection misses critical content  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive content patterns + fallback to common deck structures + on-demand processing for gaps

**Risk**: 7 pages still cause SSL issues  
**Mitigation**: Progressive reduction (7→5→3 pages) + per-page timeout + graceful text-only fallback

**Risk**: Cache grows too large  
**Mitigation**: TTL-based expiration + size limits + memory monitoring

**Risk**: Performance regression  
**Mitigation**: A/B testing during rollout + instant rollback capability + comprehensive monitoring
