# Project Overview

## Mission Statement
**Transform the `/market-research` command into a professional-grade market intelligence system that generates McKinsey/BCG quality reports for venture capital investment decisions.**

## Current Problem
The existing `/market-research` command produces inadequate output that fails to meet professional VC standards. The current synthesis system delivers substandard results because it:

- Produces only superficial 3-4 insights instead of the required 8-10 actionable insights
- Uses only 4-6 meaningful sources instead of the required 50+ comprehensive sources (expanding from current 24 sources collected)
- Generates brief Slack summaries with no comprehensive report generation
- Lacks professional structure, citations, and investment-grade recommendations
- Results in user satisfaction of 5/10 (failing grade), creating significant business impact for VC investment decision quality

**This PRD addresses strategic incremental enhancement of existing functionality to achieve professional quality standards.

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT CLARIFICATION**: "Incremental enhancement" refers to preserving existing system architecture (Flask + Slack Bolt patterns, session management, etc.) while completely replacing/rewriting synthesis logic that produces inadequate quality results. The current `/market-research` code functions technically but delivers extremely poor user experience. Developers should feel free to ignore existing synthesis implementation and build clean, professional code if current approach would compromise quality standards.**

## Target Solution
**New Professional `/market-research` Command** that delivers:

- **McKinsey/BCG Quality Reports**: 10-20 page comprehensive markdown reports
- **Deep Intelligence**: 8-10 actionable, data-backed insights per analysis
- **Comprehensive Sources**: 30+ meaningful sources synthesized professionally
- **Investment Grade**: Three-tier recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Professional Structure**: Executive Assessment, Critical Findings, Risk Matrix, Citations
- **User Satisfaction**: Target >8.5/10 (vs current failing 5/10)

## Project Scope
**Timeline**: 3 weeks to demo-ready professional market intelligence system
**Approach**: Strategic incremental enhancement of existing `/market-research` command using Single Process Architecture with BMAD Framework integration
**Quality Standard**: Reports that a VC fund would pay McKinsey/BCG to produce
**Technical Environment**: Production-only development (`TEST_MODE=false`) - no mock implementations

## Success Metrics
- **Quality**: Reports meet professional consulting standards (McKinsey/BCG level)
- **Depth**: 8-10 actionable insights (vs current 3-4 superficial)
- **Sources**: 30+ synthesized sources (vs current 4-6 meaningful)
- **Structure**: Complete 10-20 page reports (vs current brief summaries only)
- **Satisfaction**: >8.5/10 user rating (vs current 5/10 failure)
- **Decision Support**: Investment-grade recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Demo Constraint**: Single-process limitation acceptable for demo scope (multi-channel support deferred to post-demo)
