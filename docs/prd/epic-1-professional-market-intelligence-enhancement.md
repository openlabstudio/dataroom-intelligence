# Epic 1: Professional Market Intelligence Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: Transform existing `/market-research` command into McKinsey/BCG quality market intelligence system through strategic incremental enhancement of current synthesis capabilities, BMAD Framework integration, and permanent report delivery.

**Integration Requirements**: Maintain complete compatibility with existing Flask + Slack Bolt architecture, preserve session management patterns, and ensure no degradation of current `/analyze` command functionality.

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**: Preserve architectural patterns while completely rewriting synthesis components that produce inadequate results. Current `/market-research` implementation works technically but delivers poor quality (5/10 satisfaction). Developers should build clean, professional implementations rather than building on code that produces substandard output.
