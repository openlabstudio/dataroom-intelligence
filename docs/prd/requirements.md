# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The `/market-research` command shall enhance existing synthesis capabilities to generate professional-grade 10-20 page markdown reports with McKinsey/BCG consultant-level quality, including Executive Assessment, Critical Findings, Risk Matrix, and comprehensive citations.

**FR2**: The system shall expand source collection from current 24 sources to 50+ reliable sources through enhanced Tavily API integration to ensure comprehensive market analysis coverage with professional source diversity.

**FR3**: The system shall integrate BMAD Framework methodologies into existing MarketResearchOrchestrator, adding 8 distinct research types (product validation, competitive intelligence, market opportunity, etc.) with expert persona system for enhanced analysis depth.

**FR4**: The system shall enhance existing synthesis logic to generate 8-10 actionable, data-backed insights per analysis (vs current 3-4 superficial insights) with specific investment implications and supporting evidence from multiple sources.

**FR5**: The system shall implement three-tier investment recommendation system with risk assessment:
- HIGH RISK - Multiple red flags identified
- MODERATE RISK - Mixed signals, requires deep due diligence
- LOW RISK - Strong fundamentals with clear path to returns

**FR6**: The system shall enhance existing Slack integration to provide intelligent summarization (3500 chars max) that maintains current threading patterns while highlighting key insights and investment recommendations with permanent report download links.

**FR7**: The system shall preserve existing market detection capabilities while enhancing generic functionality for any market vertical/niche without requiring sector-specific hardcoding or manual configuration.

**FR8**: The system shall maintain existing response time patterns while completing enhanced market intelligence analysis and professional report generation within 2-3 minutes of command execution.

**FR9**: The system shall implement permanent report storage with downloadable .md files, integrating with existing session management without disrupting current `user_sessions` dict structure.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The enhanced system must integrate seamlessly without impacting existing `/analyze` command response times or session management functionality.

**NFR2**: The system shall complete market intelligence analysis within 2-3 minutes to provide timely decision support for VC analysts.

**NFR3**: Report generation shall achieve >8.5/10 user satisfaction rating compared to current failing 5/10 performance.

**NFR4**: The system shall support demo-first development approach with local validation before production deployment, maintaining production-quality standards throughout development cycle.

**NFR5**: All generated reports must pass professional quality gates with minimum 70% quality score before delivery to users.

**NFR6**: The system shall maintain 95% reliability rate for market research operations with graceful degradation when quality thresholds are not met.

**NFR7**: Cost efficiency shall be achieved through intelligent analysis rather than reduced API calls, prioritizing quality over cost optimization.

**NFR8**: The system shall acknowledge single-process limitation for demo scope, with multi-channel session management enhancements deferred to post-demo development.

**NFR9**: The system shall monitor Railway deployment resource usage during enhanced processing (50+ sources, 10-20 page reports) and provide alerts for resource threshold management.

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Slack Command Compatibility - All current Slack commands (`/analyze`, `/ask`, `/reset`, `/health`) must remain fully functional without modification to user experience.

**CR2**: Session Management Compatibility - In-memory `user_sessions` dict structure must be preserved to maintain compatibility with existing document analysis workflows.

**CR3**: Flask + Slack Bolt Integration Consistency - The enhanced system must integrate seamlessly with existing Flask application and Slack Bolt event handling patterns.

**CR4**: Railway Deployment Compatibility - The enhanced system must maintain compatibility with existing Railway deployment pipeline and environment variable configuration.
