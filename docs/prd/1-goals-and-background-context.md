# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1. Goals

*   **G1:** Achieve commercial-grade analysis quality suitable for professional venture capital firms.
*   **G2:** Re-architect the system to implement a professional, state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
*   **G3:** Solve the root cause of poor quality by preserving document structure (layout, tables, hierarchy) during data ingestion.
*   **G4:** Improve key data extraction accuracy to over 90%.
*   **G5:** Enable a reliable, context-aware Q&A capability.
*   **G6:** Implement a persistent, channel-based data store to manage different datarooms securely and independently.

## 1.2. Background Context

The current system fails because it treats complex, visual PDFs as simple text files. This "flattens" the document, destroying the structural context (tables, columns, headers) that is essential for accurate analysis. The result is low-quality data extraction and unreliable answers, rendering the tool unusable for professional analysis.

This project will correct this by building a proper data engineering pipeline. We will parse the document structure, convert it to a rich format (Markdown), chunk it intelligently, and build a RAG system on top of this high-fidelity data. This moves us from a flawed `PDF → GPT-4o` model to a professional `PDF → Parse → Chunk → RAG → GPT-4o` architecture.
