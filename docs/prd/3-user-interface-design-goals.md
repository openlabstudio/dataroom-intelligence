# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1. Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be akin to interacting with a competent, fast, and reliable junior analyst via a command-line interface. The bot must be professional, concise, and predictable. All interactions should inspire confidence in the data and the analysis provided.

## 3.2. Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Command-Driven:** All primary actions are initiated via clear and simple Slack slash commands (e.g., `/load`, `/connect`, `/summary`, `/ask`).
*   **Conversational Feedback:** The bot must provide clear, human-readable feedback for all operations, including success messages, error messages, and progress updates for long-running tasks as per NFR6.
*   **Data-Dense, Scannable Outputs:** Analytical outputs (`/summary`, `/ask`) must be well-structured, using Markdown formatting (bolding, bullets, etc.) to be easily scannable and digestible within the Slack interface.

## 3.3. Core Screens and Views

*   **Dataroom Load Confirmation:** A message confirming which documents were loaded.
*   **Dataroom List View (`/list`):** A formatted list showing all available Datarooms.
*   **Current Dataroom View (`/current`):** A status message detailing the Dataroom connected to the current channel.
*   **Summary Report View (`/summary`):** The structured, multi-section investment analysis report.
*   **Q&A Response View (`/ask`):** A concise answer to a user's question, with source attribution.
*   **Help View (`/help`):** A formatted message that displays all user-facing commands and their purpose.

## 3.4. Accessibility: Standard Slack Accessibility

As the UI is embedded within Slack, we will adhere to the accessibility standards provided by the Slack platform itself.

## 3.5. Branding

No custom branding is required for the MVP.

## 3.6. Target Device and Platforms: Slack Client

The interface must be fully functional and readable on all official Slack clients (Web Responsive, Desktop, and Mobile).
