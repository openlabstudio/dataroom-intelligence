# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.11+
**Frameworks**: Flask (web application), Slack Bolt (Slack integration), OpenAI Python SDK
**Database**: In-memory session storage (`user_sessions` dict), no persistent database currently
**Infrastructure**: Railway cloud deployment, environment-based configuration
**External Dependencies**: OpenAI GPT-4 API, Tavily Search API, Google Drive API, Slack API

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Maintain existing in-memory session management while adding storage for generated reports. No breaking changes to current session handling.

**API Integration Strategy**: Build new OpenAI integration with structured prompting for BMAD Framework. Expand Tavily API usage from 24 to 50+ sources. Maintain current API wrapper patterns.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Preserve existing Slack interface patterns while enhancing `/market-research` command output. Maintain consistent command acknowledgment and threading patterns.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement production-only testing approach (`TEST_MODE=false`) with real API validation. Establish quality gates for professional output validation.

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Utilize existing `agents/`, `handlers/`, `utils/` structure. Build new market intelligence system within current architecture.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing Python PEP 8 standards and current project conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for classes).

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing patterns including TEST_MODE checking, proper error handling with logger integration, and Slack acknowledgment patterns.

**Documentation Standards**: Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture patterns and maintain comprehensive docstrings for all new components.

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Leverage existing Railway auto-deployment from main branch. No changes required to current build process.

**Deployment Strategy**: Direct replacement of existing `/market-research` command with new McKinsey-quality system.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Utilize existing logger infrastructure in `utils/logger.py`. Enhance with quality metrics and professional output tracking.

**Railway Resource Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for enhanced processing loads with specific thresholds and automated responses.

### RAILWAY RESOURCE MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

**Memory Usage Monitoring**:
```yaml
Baseline Memory Usage: Current /analyze command memory profile
Enhanced Memory Targets:
  - Normal Operation: <512MB sustained memory usage
  - Peak Processing (50+ sources): <1GB maximum memory usage
  - Concurrent Users: <1.5GB total memory usage

Alert Thresholds:
  - WARNING: Memory usage >80% of current Railway plan limit
  - CRITICAL: Memory usage >90% of Railway plan limit
  - EMERGENCY: Memory usage approaching Railway plan maximum

Automated Responses:
  - WARNING: Log detailed memory usage patterns, investigate source
  - CRITICAL: Enable enhanced garbage collection, consider feature flag reduction
  - EMERGENCY: Automatic feature flag rollback for high-memory features
```

**API Cost & Usage Monitoring**:
```yaml
Cost Baselines:
  - Current Tavily API: ~$X/day for 24 sources per analysis
  - Target Enhanced: <150% of baseline cost for 50+ sources
  - OpenAI GPT-4: Monitor token usage for report generation

Monitoring Metrics:
  - API calls per minute/hour/day
  - Cost per market research analysis
  - Success/failure rates per API endpoint
  - Response time degradation patterns

Alert Thresholds:
  - Cost increase >125% baseline → Investigation alert
  - Cost increase >150% baseline → Feature flag review
  - API failure rate >10% → Service degradation alert
  - Response times >2x baseline → Performance investigation
```

**Performance & Availability Monitoring**:
```yaml  
Response Time Targets:
  - /analyze commands: Maintain existing response times (no degradation)
  - Enhanced /market-research: Complete within 2-3 minutes
  - Slack integration: Maintain existing message delivery times
  - Download endpoints: <5 seconds for report download initiation

System Health Metrics:
  - Overall system availability >99.5% uptime
  - Enhancement feature availability when flags enabled >95%
  - Concurrent user handling without performance degradation
  - Railway deployment health and auto-scaling triggers

Error Rate Monitoring:
  - Enhancement-related errors <5% of total requests
  - Existing functionality error rate unchanged from baseline  
  - Quality gate rejections tracked but not counted as system errors
  - Feature flag rollback triggers <1% of deployments
```

**Railway Platform Integration Monitoring**:
```yaml
Railway-Specific Metrics:
  - Build time monitoring for deployments with enhancements
  - Resource allocation efficiency within Railway constraints  
  - Auto-scaling triggers and effectiveness
  - Network bandwidth usage for increased source collection

Deployment Health:
  - Zero-downtime deployment success rate >95%
  - Rollback capability within 5 minutes of deployment issue detection
  - Environment variable and configuration management integrity
  - Database/session management compatibility with Railway restarts
```

**Monitoring Dashboard Requirements**:
```yaml
Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:
  - Current resource usage vs Railway plan limits
  - Enhancement feature performance metrics  
  - User satisfaction scores and trending
  - Cost analysis and budget tracking
  - Error rates and system health indicators

Alerting Integration:
  - Slack notifications for critical system alerts
  - Email escalation for unresolved critical alerts
  - Automated feature flag adjustments for resource protection
  - Railway deployment rollback triggers for critical failures
```

**Configuration Management**: Extend existing environment variable pattern with additional API keys, monitoring thresholds, and Railway-specific configuration options.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- API rate limits with increased source collection (50+ vs 24)
- Token limits with comprehensive report generation
- Integration complexity with BMAD Framework methodologies

**Integration Risks**:
- Slack command integration with existing system architecture
- Potential performance impact on other system components
- API rate limiting with increased source collection

**Deployment Risks**:
- Railway deployment pipeline compatibility
- Environment variable configuration conflicts
- Production testing costs during development

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement exponential backoff for API rate limit handling
- Use intelligent prompt compression and chunking for token management
- Direct replacement approach to avoid system conflicts
- Comprehensive monitoring and quality validation
