# 9. Epic 4: Production Readiness & Polish

**Expanded Goal:** This final epic is focused on hardening the application for production use. We will move beyond functional correctness and concentrate on reliability, observability, and creating a polished user experience. This includes rigorous testing against a suite of diverse documents, implementing structured logging for easier debugging, and refining all user-facing messages for maximum clarity.

## Stories

**Story 4.1: Create Standardized Test Suite**
*   **As a** developer, **I want** a standardized test suite of diverse and challenging documents, **so that** I can rigorously and consistently test the RAG pipeline's performance and quality.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A dedicated test folder is created in the repository.
    2.  The folder contains at least 5 distinct test cases as specified in the Project Brief: a simple deck, a document with complex tables, a visual-heavy deck, a multi-document dataroom, and a poor-quality scanned PDF.

**Story 4.2: Implement Structured, Production-Grade Logging**
*   **As a** developer, **I want** structured, context-rich logging throughout the application, **so that** I can easily trace a user request from start to finish and quickly debug issues in production.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The logging system is configured to output in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
    2.  All log entries related to a specific user request contain a unique `trace_id` and the relevant `channel_id`.
    3.  Sensitive information (e.g., API keys) is properly redacted from all logs.

**Story 4.3: Refine and Polish All User-Facing Messages**
*   **As an** analyst, **I want** all bot messages to be professional, clear, and consistently formatted, **so that** the application feels polished and trustworthy.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  A full review of all bot responses (for success, errors, help, status, etc.) is conducted.
    2.  Text is edited for clarity, professional tone, and consistency.
    3.  The use of Markdown formatting and emojis is standardized across all messages to create a cohesive user experience.

**Story 4.4: Final End-to-End Validation**
*   **As a** product owner, **I want** to perform final acceptance testing on the complete application against the full test suite, **so that** I can formally sign off on the MVP's quality and commercial viability.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The application is deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production.
    2.  All commands are tested against all documents in the standardized test suite.
    3.  The outputs are validated against the quality metrics defined in the Project Brief (e.g., >90% data extraction accuracy, response times).
    4.  The final `gemini`-level quality bar is met consistently.
