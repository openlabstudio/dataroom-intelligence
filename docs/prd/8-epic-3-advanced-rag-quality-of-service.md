# 8. Epic 3: Advanced RAG & Quality of Service

**Expanded Goal:** With core functionality in place, this epic transforms the application from a functional prototype into a professional tool. We will implement advanced RAG techniques to improve the relevance of retrieved context, leading to more accurate AI responses. We will also add robust error handling and performance optimizations to ensure the system is reliable and feels responsive.

## Stories

**Story 3.1: Implement Re-ranking in RAG Pipeline**
*   **As a** system, **I want** to re-rank the initial list of retrieved document chunks using a more powerful model, **so that** the most relevant context is prioritized and sent to the final LLM, improving answer quality.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The RAG retrieval process is updated to fetch a larger set of initial candidates (e.g., top 20).
    2.  A second-stage re-ranking model (e.g., a LlamaIndex `CohereRerank` or cross-encoder) is integrated.
    3.  The re-ranker re-orders the candidates based on relevance to the specific query.
    4.  The final, top 'k' re-ranked chunks are passed to the LLM for synthesis.

**Story 3.2: Implement Parent Document Retriever Strategy**
*   **As a** system, **I want** to retrieve larger, context-rich parent chunks after searching on smaller, more precise child chunks, **so that** the LLM has both the precision of a targeted search and the broad context needed for high-quality reasoning.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The chunking strategy is updated to create parent chunks (e.g., full sections or pages) and smaller child chunks derived from them.
    2.  The retrieval engine is configured to search for the most relevant *child* chunks.
    3.  Upon finding the best child chunks, the engine retrieves their corresponding *parent* chunks to be sent to the LLM.

**Story 3.3: Comprehensive & User-Friendly Error Handling**
*   **As an** analyst, **I want** to receive clear, helpful error messages when an operation fails, **so that** I understand what went wrong and what I can do about it.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  All primary command handlers (`/load`, `/connect`, etc.) have comprehensive error handling.
    2.  Specific, anticipated errors (e.g., "Dataroom not found," "Invalid Google Drive URL," "LlamaParse API key not set") result in user-friendly, actionable error messages posted to Slack.
    3.  Generic or unexpected errors are caught and result in a message asking the user to report the issue, along with a unique error ID for logging.

**Story 3.4: Asynchronous Processing for Long-Running Tasks**
*   **As an** analyst, **I want** long-running commands like `/load` to run in the background and provide status updates, **so that** the app feels responsive and I'm kept informed of the progress.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The `/load` command handler immediately posts an initial "Processing..." message to Slack.
    2.  The actual data processing (parsing, chunking, embedding) is executed in a background thread.
    3.  The handler posts periodic updates to the initial Slack message (e.g., "Step 1/3: Parsing documents...", "Step 2/3: Storing data...").
    4.  A final "Success" or "Failure" message is posted upon completion.
