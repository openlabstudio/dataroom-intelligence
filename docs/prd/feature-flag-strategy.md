# FEATURE FLAG STRATEGY

## Feature Flag Implementation Architecture

**Core Feature Flags Configuration**:
```python
ENHANCEMENT_FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    "bmad_framework_enabled": False,           # Story 1.1: BMAD Framework Integration
    "enhanced_source_collection": False,      # Story 1.2: 24→50+ Source Collection  
    "professional_report_generation": False,  # Story 1.3: McKinsey-Quality Reports
    "permanent_report_storage": False,        # Story 1.4: Permanent Storage System
    "enhanced_slack_integration": False,      # Story 1.5: Download Links Integration
    "quality_assurance_gates": False          # Story 1.6: Quality Validation Gates
}
```

**Feature Flag Usage Pattern**:
```python
# Example implementation in market research orchestrator
def execute_market_research(user_id, query):
    if get_feature_flag("bmad_framework_enabled", user_id):
        return enhanced_market_research_with_bmad(query)
    else:
        return legacy_market_research(query)
```

## Gradual Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Internal Validation (Week 1)**
- All flags OFF for production users
- Flags ON for development team testing only
- Target: Validate basic functionality without user impact
- Success Criteria: All existing functionality preserved, enhanced features working locally

**Phase 2: Limited Beta Testing (Week 2)**  
- Flags ON for 10% of users (feature flag percentage control)
- Monitor user satisfaction and error rates closely
- Target: Real-world validation with limited exposure
- Success Criteria: User satisfaction ≥8.5/10, error rate <5%

**Phase 3: Gradual Production Rollout (Week 3)**
- Flags ON for 25% → 50% → 100% users over 3-day intervals
- Continuous monitoring of quality metrics and performance
- Target: Full production deployment with safety controls
- Success Criteria: System stability maintained, quality targets met

**Phase 4: Flag Consolidation (Week 4)**
- Remove feature flags after 1 week of stable 100% rollout
- Clean up code to eliminate conditional logic
- Target: Production-ready system without flag overhead
- Success Criteria: Code simplified, performance optimized

## Feature Flag Management & Control

**Administrative Control Interface**:
```python
# Feature flag admin endpoints for real-time control
POST /admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/enable/{percentage}
POST /admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/disable
GET /admin/feature-flags/status
```

**Per-User Feature Flag Override**:
```python
# Allow specific users to be included/excluded from features
FEATURE_FLAG_USER_OVERRIDES = {
    "user_123": {"bmad_framework_enabled": True},    # Early access for power users
    "user_456": {"enhanced_source_collection": False} # Exclude problematic cases
}
```

**Emergency Rollback via Feature Flags**:
- All feature flags can be disabled immediately via admin interface
- No code deployment required for emergency rollback
- Gradual rollback possible (100% → 50% → 25% → 0%)
- Individual feature isolation for granular rollback control

## Feature Flag Monitoring & Metrics

**Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**:
- Feature flag activation rates per user segment
- Error rates with flags enabled vs disabled
- Performance metrics comparison (flag on vs off)
- User satisfaction scores by feature flag status

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Error rate increase >10% with any flag enabled → Auto-rollback trigger
- User satisfaction drop >1 point → Investigation alert
- Performance degradation >20% → Flag percentage reduction
- Cost increase >150% baseline → Enhanced source collection flag review
