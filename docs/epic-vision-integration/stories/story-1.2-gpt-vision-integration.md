# Story 1.2: GPT Vision Infrastructure Integration

**Story ID**: VIS-ARCH-001.2  
**Epic**: Intelligent Visual Document Extraction & Complete Architecture Simplification  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days  
**Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (TEST_MODE elimination must complete first)  

## User Story

As a **VC analyst**,  
I want **GPT-4V/5V vision capabilities integrated into the document processing pipeline**,  
so that **charts, graphs, and complex visual layouts enhance analysis quality for `/ask`, `/gaps`, and all document-based commands**.

## Problem Statement

Current regex-based extraction cannot analyze visual elements, charts, graphs, or complex PDF layouts. This limits the quality of analysis across all commands that depend on document understanding.

## Solution

Integrate GPT-4V/5V vision capabilities as a complementary layer to existing text extraction, with intelligent cost controls and seamless integration into the user session data structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms to text-only extraction when vision fails
- [ ] Establish vision API timeout handling (30 seconds max per page)

### AC2: Visual Content Detection
- [ ] Implement automatic detection of visual elements in PDF documents
- [ ] Create logic to identify when GPT Vision analysis adds value
- [ ] Develop content complexity scoring for processing decisions
- [ ] Establish criteria for vision vs text-only processing paths

### AC3: Image Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Convert PDF pages to images suitable for GPT Vision analysis
- [ ] Implement image optimization for API efficiency and cost control
- [ ] Create batch processing for multi-page documents

## Integration Verification

### IV1: Enhanced Gap Analysis
**Verification**: `/gaps` command identifies missing information using both text and visual document analysis
- Upload document with charts/graphs missing key information
- Execute `/gaps` command and verify visual analysis is incorporated
- Confirm gaps identified include visual content analysis results

### IV2: Visual Element Q&A
**Verification**: `/ask` command can answer questions about charts and visual elements using GPT Vision data
- Upload document with financial charts or diagrams
- Ask specific questions about visual elements
- Verify responses incorporate GPT Vision analysis results

### IV3: Seamless Pipeline Integration
**Verification**: Vision-extracted data integrates seamlessly with existing AI analysis pipeline for all commands
- Test all commands with vision-enhanced documents
- Verify session data contains both text and visual results
- Confirm no command functionality is degraded

## Technical Implementation

### New Components to Create

#### Vision Processing Module (`utils/vision_processor.py`)
```python
class VisionProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        # GPT Vision client setup
        
    def should_use_vision(self, document_content):
        # Intelligence decision for vision processing
        
    def process_pdf_pages(self, pdf_path):
        # Convert PDF to images and analyze
        
    def analyze_visual_content(self, image_data):
        # GPT Vision API integration
        
    def estimate_processing_cost(self, page_count):
        # Cost estimation logic
```

#### Enhanced Session Manager (`utils/enhanced_session.py`)
```python
class EnhancedSessionData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.text_extraction = {}
        self.visual_extraction = {}
        self.combined_insights = {}
        
    def add_vision_results(self, vision_data):
        # Store vision analysis results
        
    def get_comprehensive_data(self):
        # Return combined text and visual data
```
