**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days *(Revised down from 4-6 days due to Story 1.2 completing ~40% of scope)*  
**Dependencies**: Story 1.2 (GPT Vision infrastructure must be available) ‚úÖ COMPLETED  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SCOPE UPDATE POST-STORY 1.2 INTEGRATION

**Context**: Story 1.2 implementation included basic command integration, completing ~40% of original Story 1.3 scope.

- Vision data availability in all commands (/ask, /gaps, /scoring, /memo)
- Basic command enhancement hooks and integration points
- Session data structure supporting vision results

**üéØ REMAINING FOR STORY 1.3 (FOCUS AREAS):**

## User Story

As a **VC analyst using any analysis command**,  
I want **all document analysis commands (`/ask`, `/gaps`, `/scoring`, `/memo`) to benefit from enhanced visual and textual extraction**,  
so that **every command provides more accurate and comprehensive insights based on complete document understanding**.

## Problem Statement

Current commands rely solely on text extraction, missing critical insights from visual elements. With GPT Vision infrastructure now available, all analysis commands need enhancement to leverage both text and visual document understanding.

## Solution

Systematically enhance all document analysis commands to incorporate both text and visual extraction results, ensuring comprehensive document understanding improves every user interaction.

- Upload deck with market size charts
- Ask "What does the market size chart show?"
- Verify response incorporates GPT Vision analysis of visual content

### IV3: Comprehensive Analysis Integration
**Verification**: `/scoring` and `/memo` commands incorporate insights from both textual and visual document analysis
- Execute `/scoring` on deck with visual and text content
- Execute `/memo` on same deck

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced AI Analyzer (`handlers/ai_analyzer.py`)

#### Enhanced Gap Analysis
```python
def analyze_gaps(self, processed_documents, document_summary):
    # Get comprehensive extraction data
    text_data = session_data.get('extracted_text', {})
    visual_data = session_data.get('visual_analysis', {})
    
    # Combine insights for comprehensive gap analysis
    comprehensive_analysis = self._synthesize_extraction_data(text_data, visual_data)
    
    # Enhanced gap identification including visual elements
    return self._identify_comprehensive_gaps(comprehensive_analysis)
```

#### Enhanced Investment Memo
```python
def generate_investment_memo(self, processed_documents, document_summary):
    # Access enhanced extraction results
    enhanced_data = self._get_comprehensive_document_data()
    
    # Include visual insights in memo generation
    memo_content = self._create_enhanced_memo(enhanced_data)
    
    return memo_content
```

```python
def get_comprehensive_analysis_data(user_id):
    session = user_sessions.get(user_id, {})
    return {
        'text_extraction': session.get('extracted_text', {}),
        'visual_analysis': session.get('visual_analysis', {}),
        'combined_insights': session.get('combined_insights', {}),
