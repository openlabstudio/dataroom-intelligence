# Epic: Intelligent Visual Document Extraction & Complete Architecture Simplification

**Epic ID**: VIS-ARCH-001  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks  
**Dependencies**: None (foundational epic)  

## Epic Goal

Transform the document extraction system from primitive regex-based processing to intelligent visual analysis using GPT-4V/5V while completely eliminating TEST_MODE complexity from ALL commands, ensuring enhanced extraction improves response quality across `/ask`, `/gaps`, `/scoring`, `/memo`, and all user-facing functionality.

## Problem Statement

The current DataRoom Intelligence system suffers from two critical limitations:

1. **Primitive Extraction**: Basic regex patterns cannot analyze visual elements, charts, graphs, or complex layouts
2. **Architectural Complexity**: TEST_MODE/PRODUCTION_MODE dual architecture creates unnecessary code bloat with 87+ conditional logic points

## Solution Overview

**Dual Enhancement Approach**:
- Replace regex-based extraction with GPT-4V/5V visual intelligence
- Eliminate all TEST_MODE infrastructure for simplified production-only development

## Key Benefits

✅ **Enhanced Analysis Quality**: All commands benefit from visual document understanding  
✅ **Simplified Architecture**: 50%+ reduction in conditional logic complexity  
✅ **Streamlined Development**: Production-only workflow eliminates mode configuration  
✅ **Universal Command Enhancement**: `/ask`, `/gaps`, `/scoring`, `/memo` all improved  
✅ **Cost-Controlled Intelligence**: Smart vision usage with budget management  

## Integration Requirements

**Cross-Command Impact**: All document analysis commands must function without TEST_MODE conditional logic while accessing enhanced extraction data.

**Session Data Enhancement**: User sessions must contain unified extraction results accessible across all commands.

**Backward Compatibility**: Existing command interfaces remain unchanged while providing improved results.

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete TEST_MODE Elimination**: Zero conditional logic across all commands
2. **Visual Analysis Integration**: GPT Vision insights available to all analysis functions  
3. **Quality Improvement**: Measurable enhancement in response accuracy across all commands
4. **Architecture Simplification**: Documented 50%+ reduction in code complexity
5. **Production Workflow**: Seamless development with production APIs only

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks**: GPT Vision API limits, processing timeouts, cost management  
**Integration Risks**: Session compatibility, command response consistency  
**Mitigation**: Intelligent cost controls, graceful fallbacks, phased implementation  

## Story Breakdown

1. **Story 1.1**: Complete TEST_MODE Infrastructure Elimination
2. **Story 1.2**: GPT Vision Infrastructure Integration  
3. **Story 1.3**: Enhanced Document Analysis for All Commands
4. **Story 1.4**: Intelligent Multi-Format Processing
5. **Story 1.5**: Production-Only Development Workflow

## Implementation Sequence

**Phase 1**: TEST_MODE elimination (Stories 1.1, 1.5)  
**Phase 2**: GPT Vision integration (Story 1.2)  
**Phase 3**: Command enhancement (Stories 1.3, 1.4)  

**Dependencies**: Stories 1.1 and 1.5 must complete before 1.2-1.4 to ensure clean foundation.
