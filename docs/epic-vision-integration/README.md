## Development Team Guidance

### Before Starting Development
1. **Review Epic Overview**: Understand goals and integration requirements
2. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure proper story sequencing (1.1 ‚Üí 1.5 ‚Üí 1.2 ‚Üí 1.3/1.4)
3. **Environment Setup**: Follow simplified production-only configuration
4. **Cost Monitoring**: Establish development budget controls

### During Development
1. **Follow Story Acceptance Criteria**: Each story has detailed, testable criteria
2. **Reference Technical Requirements**: Use as authoritative specification source
3. **Apply Technical Guidance**: Follow implementation patterns and quality standards
4. **Validate Integration Points**: Ensure cross-command compatibility throughout

### Quality Assurance
1. **Story Definition of Done**: Each story has specific completion criteria
2. **Integration Verification**: Test points ensure cross-story compatibility
3. **Performance Validation**: Verify non-functional requirement compliance
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality preservation

## Key Implementation Notes

### Critical Dependencies
- **Story 1.1 MUST complete before all others** - Foundation for clean implementation
- **Phase approach REQUIRED** - Prevents integration conflicts and ensures stability
- **Cost controls ESSENTIAL** - Vision processing requires budget management throughout

### Architecture Principles
- **Production-only operation** - No TEST_MODE conditional logic anywhere
- **Unified session data** - Enhanced structure accessible to all commands
- **Graceful degradation** - Text-only fallbacks for all vision processing
- **Cost-aware processing** - Intelligent decisions based on budget and quality trade-offs

### Quality Standards
- **Measurable improvements** - All enhancements must demonstrate quantifiable benefits
- **Backward compatibility** - Zero breaking changes to existing command interfaces
- **Error resilience** - Robust fallback mechanisms for all processing paths
- **Documentation accuracy** - Implementation must match specification exactly
