# Story 1.1: BMAD Framework Integration into Existing Architecture

**Epic**: Professional Market Intelligence Enhancement  
**Story ID**: 1.1  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  

## User Story

As a **VC analyst**,
I want **the system to integrate BMAD Framework methodologies into existing MarketResearchOrchestrator**,
so that **I can receive enhanced market analysis with professional intelligence depth**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. BMAD Framework modules integrated into existing `agents/market_research_orchestrator.py`
2. Expert persona system with 8 research types (product validation, competitive intelligence, etc.) added to current architecture
3. Enhanced synthesis logic integrated with existing Single Process Architecture
4. BMAD integration documented in updated CLAUDE.md with component enhancement details
5. Demo-first development approach established with local validation capabilities

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: All existing Slack commands (`/analyze`, `/ask`, `/reset`, `/health`) function identically
- **IV2**: Session management through `user_sessions` dict remains unaffected
- **IV3**: Enhanced system integrates seamlessly with existing Railway deployment pipeline

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Maintain complete compatibility with existing Flask + Slack Bolt architecture
- Preserve session management patterns
- Ensure no degradation of current `/analyze` command functionality
- Build on existing Single Process Architecture foundation

- [ ] BMAD Framework integrated into MarketResearchOrchestrator
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved and verified
