## Development Approach

**Integration Requirements**: Maintain complete compatibility with existing Flask + Slack Bolt architecture, preserve session management patterns, and ensure no degradation of current `/analyze` command functionality.

**DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY**: Preserve architectural patterns while completely rewriting synthesis components that produce inadequate results. Build clean, professional implementations rather than building on code that produces substandard output.

## Story Dependencies
