## User Story

As a **VC analyst analyzing a startup in a specific sector**,
I want **market research to analyze the correct market vertical and competitors in production**,
So that **my investment decisions are based on accurate competitive landscape data, not wrong industry analysis**.

---

## Story Context

### Problem Statement
- **PRODUCTION_MODE:** Tavily API returns wrong market data (duty-free retail vs VAT refund platforms for STAMP)
- **TEST_MODE:** Generates correct sector-aware market analysis (tax-free shopping for STAMP) ✅ (DO NOT CHANGE)
- **Root Cause:** Search queries to Tavily API too generic, don't use market profile context effectively

### Current System Integration
- **Integrates with:** `MarketResearchOrchestrator` in `agents/market_research_orchestrator.py:469-569`
- **Technology:** Tavily API integration, market profile context passing
- **File Locations:** `_search_competitive_intelligence()`, `_search_market_validation()`, `_search_funding_intelligence()`
- **Touch points:** 3-level search strategy (solution → sub-vertical → vertical)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **PRODUCTION_MODE** search queries use market profile context to generate sector-specific terms for Tavily API
2. **TEST_MODE** mock data generation remains unchanged (already sector-aware and working correctly)
3. For STAMP test case in production: searches return "VAT refund platform" market data not "duty-free retail"

### Integration Requirements
4. Existing `MarketResearchOrchestrator.perform_market_intelligence()` orchestration continues unchanged
5. New search generation follows existing 3-level query pattern (solution/sub-vertical/vertical) 
6. Integration with Tavily API maintains current request/response format and rate limits

### Quality Requirements
7. Market classification accuracy improves from 30% to >90% in production testing
8. Competitor relevance improves from 20% to >80% in production testing
9. Search query generation tested with STAMP scenario (FinTech/Tax-Free Shopping) and 2+ other sectors

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Bug Locations

#### File: `agents/market_research_orchestrator.py`

**Lines 469-501: `_search_competitive_intelligence()`**
```python
def _search_competitive_intelligence(self, market_profile: MarketProfile) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    solution = market_profile.solution
    sub_vertical = market_profile.sub_vertical  
    vertical = market_profile.vertical
    
    # PROBLEM: Queries too generic, don't use context effectively
    all_queries = []
    
    if solution:
        all_queries.extend([
            f"{solution} competitors market analysis",  # TOO GENERIC
            f"{solution} companies vendors providers"   # TOO GENERIC
        ])
```

**Lines 503-535: `_search_market_validation()`**
```python
# Similar issue: Generic search terms don't leverage market context
```

**Lines 537-569: `_search_funding_intelligence()`**  
```python
# Similar issue: Generic funding searches miss sector-specific patterns
```

### Solution Approach
1. **Enhanced Query Generation:** Use market profile components more intelligently
2. **Sector-Specific Terms:** Add sector-aware query patterns
3. **Competitor-Focused Searches:** Include known competitor patterns for common sectors

### Example Improved Queries for STAMP (FinTech/Tax-Free Shopping):
```python
# Current (generic):
"tax-free shopping competitors market analysis"

# Improved (specific):  
"VAT refund platform competitors Global Blue Planet Payment"
"tax-free shopping technology companies digital platforms"
"duty-free shopping vs VAT refund platform difference"
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: STAMP Production Market Classification
**Setup:** PRODUCTION_MODE=true, STAMP FinTech/Tax-Free Shopping analysis
**Current Bug:** Returns "duty-free retail market" analysis 
**Expected:** Returns "VAT refund platform" or "tax-free shopping technology" analysis
**Success:** Correct market vertical identification

### Test Case 2: STAMP Production Competitor Discovery
**Setup:** Same STAMP scenario
**Current Bug:** Returns Clearvat, Fiscozen (Italian tax compliance - wrong sector)
**Expected:** Returns Global Blue, Planet Payment, Refundit (actual VAT refund platforms)
**Success:** >80% competitor relevance

### Test Case 3: TEST_MODE Regression Prevention
**Setup:** TEST_MODE=true, STAMP analysis
**Expected:** Continue generating correct FinTech/tax-free shopping mock analysis
**Must Pass:** No degradation in TEST_MODE quality (maintain 7/10)

### Test Case 4: Other Sectors Validation
**Setup:** Test with HealthTech and CleanTech startups in PRODUCTION_MODE
**Expected:** Sector-appropriate market data and competitors
**Success:** >90% market classification accuracy across sectors

## Definition of Done

- [x] **PRODUCTION_MODE:** STAMP returns "VAT refund platform" market analysis instead of "duty-free retail"
- [x] **PRODUCTION_MODE:** STAMP competitor results include relevant players (Global Blue, Planet Payment)
- [x] **TEST_MODE:** No regression - continues generating sector-aware mock data correctly
- [x] Search query generation effectively uses market profile (vertical, sub_vertical, solution) context
- [x] Enhanced queries tested with Tavily API - confirm improved data relevance
- [x] Integration tests pass for all 3 search functions (`_search_*` methods)
- [x] Manual testing confirms >90% market classification accuracy
- [x] Manual testing confirms >80% competitor relevance improvement

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk
**Medium Risk:** Tavily API integration changes could affect data quality or rate limits

### Mitigation Strategy
- Preserve existing search structure and API calls
- Enhance query generation only, maintain result processing
- Test with multiple sectors to avoid over-optimization for STAMP
- Monitor Tavily API response quality during development

### Rollback Plan
```python
# Revert to original generic query generation
# Existing search methods already have this fallback logic
if enhanced_queries_fail:
    return original_generic_queries()
```

## Implementation Dependencies

### Prerequisite
- **MR-FIX-01 (Reference Numbering)** should be completed first
- Minimal dependency, but cleaner to test with working references

### Enables
- **MR-FIX-03 (GPT-4 Synthesis)** will benefit from better input data from improved searches
