# Story 1.2: Enhanced Multi-Source Intelligence Collection

**Epic**: Professional Market Intelligence Enhancement  
**Story ID**: 1.2  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  

## User Story

As a **VC analyst**,
I want **the system to expand existing source collection from current 24 to 50+ high-quality sources through enhanced Tavily API integration**,
so that **market analysis is based on comprehensive, reliable data with professional source diversity**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Existing Tavily API integration enhanced to expand from current 24 to 50+ verified sources per analysis
2. Intelligent source quality scoring and filtering implemented
3. Multi-API integration (Tavily enhanced, additional pay-per-use APIs)
4. Source diversity validation (geographic, temporal, domain variety)
5. Rate limiting and exponential backoff for API management
6. Source traceability for professional citation requirements

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Enhanced collection operates independently without affecting other system functionality
- **IV2**: API costs monitored and controlled within acceptable parameters
- **IV3**: Source collection failure gracefully degrades without system disruption

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Build upon existing Tavily API integration
- Implement intelligent source quality scoring
- Add multi-API support with proper rate limiting
- Ensure graceful degradation on API failures
- Maintain cost control mechanisms

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Source collection expanded from 24 to 50+ sources
- [ ] Quality scoring and filtering implemented
- [ ] Multi-API integration operational
- [ ] Rate limiting and backoff strategies in place
- [ ] Source traceability system functional
- [ ] Cost monitoring and controls active
- [ ] Integration verification tests pass
