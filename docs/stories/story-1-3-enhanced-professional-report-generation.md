# Story 1.3: Enhanced Professional Report Generation

**Epic**: Professional Market Intelligence Enhancement  
**Story ID**: 1.3  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days  

## User Story

As a **VC analyst**,
I want **the system to enhance existing synthesis capabilities in expert_formatter.py to generate comprehensive 10-20 page markdown reports with professional structure and citations**,
so that **I receive consultant-quality analysis suitable for investment committee presentation**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Existing `expert_formatter.py` enhanced with professional report templates (Executive Assessment, Critical Findings, Risk Matrix, etc.)
2. Current synthesis logic upgraded to produce 8-10 actionable insights per report (vs current 3-4 superficial insights)
3. Professional citation system integrated with existing source processing
4. Enhanced markdown formatting optimized for professional presentation
5. Quality validation gates integrated ensuring minimum 70% quality score
6. Investment recommendations with risk assessment (HIGH RISK, MODERATE RISK, LOW RISK)

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Report generation operates asynchronously without blocking Slack command responses
- **IV2**: Generated reports stored without interfering with session data structures
- **IV3**: Memory usage controlled to prevent system resource conflicts
