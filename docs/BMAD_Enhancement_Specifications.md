## ENHANCEMENT OVERVIEW

### Core Enhancement: Market Intelligence Evolution
Transform `/market-research` command from basic analysis to professional-grade market intelligence system that analyzes **market potential independent of startup quality**.

### Primary Goal
Enable VC analysts to understand market potential and investment attractiveness of a solution/vertical regardless of startup documentation quality, delivering consultant-level intelligence reports.

## SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS REQUESTED

### 1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY ENHANCEMENT

#### Enhanced `/market-research` Command
**Current State**: Basic market analysis with dual processing (inefficient)
**Target State**: Single comprehensive market analysis generating 15-20 page professional reports

**Specific Requirements**:
- **Analysis Focus**: Market/solution analysis independent of startup quality
- **Output Quality**: Consultant-level depth (McKinsey/BCG standard)
- **Report Length**: 15-20 pages in Markdown format
- **Processing**: Single unified process (eliminate current dual pipeline)
- **Delivery**: Slack summary (3500 chars) + full Markdown report
- **Sources**: 50+ verified sources (current: 24)
- **Decision Support**: Clear PROCEED/PASS investment recommendations

#### Architecture Improvement
**Current Problem**: Dual processing creates inconsistencies and redundancy
**Solution**: Single deep analysis → Full report → Intelligent summarization

### 2. NEW COMMAND CAPABILITIES

#### `/verify` - Claims Verification System
**Purpose**: Compare startup dataroom claims against verified market reality
**Input**: Existing dataroom analysis + generated market intelligence
**Output**: Discrepancy report highlighting exaggerations, false claims, competitive blindness
**Unique Value**: Automated fact-checking that no competitor offers

#### `/ask-reports` - Living Document Intelligence
**Purpose**: Query any generated report with natural language questions
**Input**: Natural language question
**Output**: Specific answers with citations from accumulated reports
**Context**: All reports generated for startup over time (weeks/months)

#### `/search` - Ad-hoc Market Intelligence
**Purpose**: Quick market intelligence without full report generation
**Input**: Specific market/competitor query
**Output**: Synthesized intelligence brief (<1000 characters for Slack)
**Speed**: <15 seconds response time

#### `/memo` - Investment Memo Generator
**Purpose**: Generate standardized investment memo from accumulated intelligence
**Input**: All session data and generated reports
**Output**: Professional investment committee memo
**Template**: Fund-specific format integration

### 3. INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS

#### Session Persistence System
**Current State**: Sessions lost between commands
**Target State**: Persistent sessions throughout entire investment evaluation (weeks/months)
**Technology**: Redis-backed storage
**Scope**: One Slack channel = One startup = Complete decision timeline

#### Intelligent Caching System
**Purpose**: Reduce API costs by 40-50% while maintaining data freshness
**Technology**: Multi-tier Redis caching
**Strategy**: Market data caching, competitor intelligence caching, search result caching
**TTL Strategy**: Variable expiration based on data type

#### Quality Gates System
**Purpose**: Ensure professional quality before any output reaches users
**Validation**: Data sufficiency, analysis completeness, source quality, output coherence
**Fallback**: Graceful degradation when quality thresholds not met
**Threshold**: Minimum 70% quality score before delivery

### 4. BMAD FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

#### Adaptive Research Types (8 Types)
**Purpose**: Tailor analysis approach based on startup stage and market characteristics
**Types**: product_validation, market_opportunity, competitive_intelligence, user_customer, technology_innovation, industry_ecosystem, strategic_options, risk_feasibility
**Implementation**: BMADPromptGenerator with context-aware prompt selection

#### Expert Persona System
**Purpose**: AI assumes appropriate expert role for each analysis type
**Personas**: Technical Product Analyst, Market Research Analyst, Competitive Intelligence Specialist, etc.
**Integration**: Persona-specific prompts and analysis frameworks

#### Structured Prompt Generation
**Purpose**: Replace generic prompts with specialized, context-aware analysis instructions
**Components**: Research context, objectives, prioritized questions, methodology requirements, output structure, adaptive instructions
**Quality**: Professional consulting standards (PESTEL, Porter frameworks, confidence scores)

### 5. OUTPUT QUALITY ENHANCEMENTS

#### Professional Report Templates
**Format**: 15-20 page Markdown reports with professional structure
**Sections**: Executive Assessment, Critical Findings, Risk Matrix, Data Gaps, Next Steps
**Citations**: Inline citation system with full source traceability
**Standards**: Investment committee ready

#### Intelligent Summarization
**Purpose**: Convert comprehensive reports into actionable Slack summaries
**Focus**: Investment decision, key findings, competitive intelligence, risks, next steps
**Personalization**: Adapted for user role (Partner vs Analyst)
**Coherence**: Perfect alignment between summary and full report
