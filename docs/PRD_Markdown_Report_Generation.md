# Product Requirements Document: Market Intelligence Report Generation

## Executive Summary
Feature to generate comprehensive market intelligence reports in Markdown format, providing VCs with professional, data-driven analysis of investment categories/solutions (not specific companies). Reports assess whether a market/solution is venture-backable, overcoming Slack's 4000-character limitation.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **4000-character Slack limit** forces extreme summarization
- **Lost insights**: Only 4 references shown vs 24+ collected sources
- **No market depth**: Can't show full competitive landscape (20+ players)

- **Missing intelligence**: Surface-level market assessment when VCs need deep category analysis

### User Pain Points (VC Analyst Perspective)
1. **Investment Thesis Validation**: Need to validate if a category is worth investing in
2. **Market Intelligence**: Require comprehensive competitive landscape analysis

### Generation Flow
```python
# Automatically triggered at end of /market-research
def complete_market_research():
    # ... existing market research ...
    
    # Generate comprehensive report
    markdown_report = generate_market_intelligence_report(
        market_data=market_intelligence_result,
        all_sources=collected_sources,
        analysis_results=session_data
    )
    
    # Upload to Slack
    client.files_upload(
        channels=channel_id,
        content=markdown_report,
        filename=f"market_intelligence_{vertical}_{timestamp}.md",
        title="ðŸ“Š Market Intelligence Report - Full Analysis"
    )
```
