## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
**IDE-based fresh analysis** - Working with current project state after revert to commit 98d2b80

### Current Project State
**DataRoom Intelligence Bot** is currently a functioning AI-powered data room analysis system for venture capital firms. The system successfully:

- Processes PDF documents from Google Drive links via `/analyze` command
- Extracts structured information using **primitive regex-based text extraction**
- Performs market research via `/market-research` command with web search integration
- Provides Q&A functionality via `/ask` command on analyzed documents
- Supports additional analysis commands: `/scoring`, `/memo`, `/gaps`
- Operates with TEST_MODE/PRODUCTION_MODE dual architecture

**Current Extraction Limitations** (the problem we're solving):
- Relies on basic regex patterns for information extraction
- Cannot analyze visual elements, charts, graphs, or complex layouts
- Misses contextual information that's visually apparent but textually ambiguous
- Limited to text-based pattern matching without semantic understanding

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **New Feature Addition** + **Major Feature Modification** + **Code Simplification**

**Enhancement Description**: 
Replace the current primitive regex-based deck information extraction with an intelligent visual analysis system using GPT-4V/5V AND eliminate the entire TEST_MODE architecture. The system will analyze PDF pages as images while removing all mock responses, test mode flags, and development/production mode complexity. All development and testing will be done directly with production APIs.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Significant Impact** (substantial existing code changes)
- Complete removal of TEST_MODE/PRODUCTION_MODE dual architecture from ALL commands
- Deletion of all mock response systems and test mode handlers (87+ conditional logic points)
- Simplification of codebase by removing conditional logic throughout all Slack commands
- New GPT Vision integration with production-only approach
- Streamlined development workflow with direct API testing

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Replace primitive regex extraction with intelligent visual PDF analysis using GPT-4V/5V
• **ELIMINATE TEST_MODE completely** from ALL commands - remove all mock responses and test mode infrastructure  
• **Simplify codebase** by removing dual-mode architecture and conditional TEST_MODE logic across entire system
• **Enhance ALL commands** (`/ask`, `/gaps`, `/scoring`, `/memo`) with improved extraction quality
• Enable direct production API development and testing workflow
• Maintain hybrid approach combining visual analysis with existing text extraction capabilities
• Preserve backward compatibility with current document processing workflow (minus TEST_MODE complexity)

**Background Context**:
The current system suffers from two major issues: primitive regex-based extraction AND unnecessary architectural complexity from the TEST_MODE system. The dual-mode approach has created code bloat with mock responses, conditional logic, and development complexity across ALL commands without providing real value.

Professional development should work directly with production APIs, accepting the API costs as a necessary part of building quality software. Eliminating TEST_MODE will simplify the codebase, reduce maintenance burden, and streamline the development process while implementing superior GPT Vision-based extraction that improves response quality across all user-facing commands.
