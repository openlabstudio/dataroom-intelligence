# DataRoom Intelligence Professional Market Research PRD

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
**Transform the `/market-research` command into a professional-grade market intelligence system that generates McKinsey/BCG quality reports for venture capital investment decisions.**

### Current Problem
The existing `/market-research` command produces inadequate output that fails to meet professional VC standards. The current synthesis system delivers substandard results because it:

- Produces only superficial 3-4 insights instead of the required 8-10 actionable insights
- Uses only 4-6 meaningful sources instead of the required 50+ comprehensive sources (expanding from current 24 sources collected)
- Generates brief Slack summaries with no comprehensive report generation
- Lacks professional structure, citations, and investment-grade recommendations
- Results in user satisfaction of 5/10 (failing grade), creating significant business impact for VC investment decision quality

**This PRD addresses strategic incremental enhancement of existing functionality to achieve professional quality standards.

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT CLARIFICATION**: "Incremental enhancement" refers to preserving existing system architecture (Flask + Slack Bolt patterns, session management, etc.) while completely replacing/rewriting synthesis logic that produces inadequate quality results. The current `/market-research` code functions technically but delivers extremely poor user experience. Developers should feel free to ignore existing synthesis implementation and build clean, professional code if current approach would compromise quality standards.**

### Target Solution
**New Professional `/market-research` Command** that delivers:

- **McKinsey/BCG Quality Reports**: 10-20 page comprehensive markdown reports
- **Deep Intelligence**: 8-10 actionable, data-backed insights per analysis
- **Comprehensive Sources**: 30+ meaningful sources synthesized professionally
- **Investment Grade**: Three-tier recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Professional Structure**: Executive Assessment, Critical Findings, Risk Matrix, Citations
- **User Satisfaction**: Target >8.5/10 (vs current failing 5/10)

### Project Scope
**Timeline**: 3 weeks to demo-ready professional market intelligence system
**Approach**: Strategic incremental enhancement of existing `/market-research` command using Single Process Architecture with BMAD Framework integration
**Quality Standard**: Reports that a VC fund would pay McKinsey/BCG to produce
**Technical Environment**: Production-only development (`TEST_MODE=false`) - no mock implementations

### Success Metrics
- **Quality**: Reports meet professional consulting standards (McKinsey/BCG level)
- **Depth**: 8-10 actionable insights (vs current 3-4 superficial)
- **Sources**: 30+ synthesized sources (vs current 4-6 meaningful)
- **Structure**: Complete 10-20 page reports (vs current brief summaries only)
- **Satisfaction**: >8.5/10 user rating (vs current 5/10 failure)
- **Decision Support**: Investment-grade recommendations with confidence scoring
- **Demo Constraint**: Single-process limitation acceptable for demo scope (multi-channel support deferred to post-demo)

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with sequential story implementation to deliver cohesive market intelligence enhancement.

The strategic incremental enhancement approach requires coordinated development of multiple existing components (agents, handlers, utils) with BMAD Framework integration. The interdependencies between enhanced source collection, professional report generation, and quality assurance make this most suitable for unified development approach.

## Epic 1: Professional Market Intelligence Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: Transform existing `/market-research` command into McKinsey/BCG quality market intelligence system through strategic incremental enhancement of current synthesis capabilities, BMAD Framework integration, and permanent report delivery.

**Integration Requirements**: Maintain complete compatibility with existing Flask + Slack Bolt architecture, preserve session management patterns, and ensure no degradation of current `/analyze` command functionality.

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**: Preserve architectural patterns while completely rewriting synthesis components that produce inadequate results. Current `/market-research` implementation works technically but delivers poor quality (5/10 satisfaction). Developers should build clean, professional implementations rather than building on code that produces substandard output.

## FEATURE FLAG STRATEGY

### Feature Flag Implementation Architecture

**Core Feature Flags Configuration**:
```python
ENHANCEMENT_FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    "bmad_framework_enabled": False,           # Story 1.1: BMAD Framework Integration
    "enhanced_source_collection": False,      # Story 1.2: 24→50+ Source Collection
    "professional_report_generation": False,  # Story 1.3: McKinsey-Quality Reports
    "permanent_report_storage": False,        # Story 1.4: Permanent Storage System
    "enhanced_slack_integration": False,      # Story 1.5: Download Links Integration
    "quality_assurance_gates": False          # Story 1.6: Quality Validation Gates
}
```

**Feature Flag Usage Pattern**:
```python
# Example implementation in market research orchestrator
def execute_market_research(user_id, query):
    if get_feature_flag("bmad_framework_enabled", user_id):
        return enhanced_market_research_with_bmad(query)
    else:
        return legacy_market_research(query)
```

### Gradual Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Internal Validation (Week 1)**
- All flags OFF for production users
- Flags ON for development team testing only
- Target: Validate basic functionality without user impact
- Success Criteria: All existing functionality preserved, enhanced features working locally

**Phase 2: Limited Beta Testing (Week 2)**
- Flags ON for 10% of users (feature flag percentage control)
- Monitor user satisfaction and error rates closely
- Target: Real-world validation with limited exposure
- Success Criteria: User satisfaction ≥8.5/10, error rate <5%

**Phase 3: Gradual Production Rollout (Week 3)**
- Flags ON for 25% → 50% → 100% users over 3-day intervals
- Continuous monitoring of quality metrics and performance
- Target: Full production deployment with safety controls
- Success Criteria: System stability maintained, quality targets met

**Phase 4: Flag Consolidation (Week 4)**
- Remove feature flags after 1 week of stable 100% rollout
- Clean up code to eliminate conditional logic
- Target: Production-ready system without flag overhead
- Success Criteria: Code simplified, performance optimized

### Feature Flag Management & Control

**Administrative Control Interface**:
```python
# Feature flag admin endpoints for real-time control
POST /admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/enable/{percentage}
POST /admin/feature-flags/{flag_name}/disable
GET /admin/feature-flags/status
```

**Per-User Feature Flag Override**:
```python
# Allow specific users to be included/excluded from features
FEATURE_FLAG_USER_OVERRIDES = {
    "user_123": {"bmad_framework_enabled": True},    # Early access for power users
    "user_456": {"enhanced_source_collection": False} # Exclude problematic cases
}
```

**Emergency Rollback via Feature Flags**:
- All feature flags can be disabled immediately via admin interface
- No code deployment required for emergency rollback
- Gradual rollback possible (100% → 50% → 25% → 0%)
- Individual feature isolation for granular rollback control

### Feature Flag Monitoring & Metrics

**Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**:
- Feature flag activation rates per user segment
- Error rates with flags enabled vs disabled
- Performance metrics comparison (flag on vs off)
- User satisfaction scores by feature flag status

**Alert Thresholds**:
- Error rate increase >10% with any flag enabled → Auto-rollback trigger
- User satisfaction drop >1 point → Investigation alert
- Performance degradation >20% → Flag percentage reduction
- Cost increase >150% baseline → Enhanced source collection flag review
