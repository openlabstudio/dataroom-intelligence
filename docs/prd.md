# Product Requirements Document: DataRoom Intelligence - Professional Market Intelligence Evolution

## 1. Executive Summary

DataRoom Intelligence currently provides basic AI-powered market research but suffers from an inefficient architecture that creates inconsistent outputs and lacks the analytical depth required for professional investment decisions. This brownfield project will re-architect the platform into a Professional Market Intelligence System. We will replace the redundant, separate processes for Slack and full reports with a single, comprehensive analysis pipeline, ensuring consistent, high-quality intelligence across all outputs.

This evolution will introduce a suite of post-analysis tools, transforming static reports into a queryable "living intelligence asset" and enabling automated fact-checking of startup claims against market reality with a new `/verify` command. Key infrastructure upgrades, including Redis-backed session persistence and automated Quality Gates, will ensure reliability and scalability. This strategic enhancement is projected to reduce manual verification work for VC analysts by up to 70%, providing a decisive competitive advantage and unlocking the underserved mid-market VC segment.

## 2. Problem Statement

#### **Current State**
DataRoom Intelligence is a functional MVP that successfully automates basic data room analysis and market research using a cost-optimized, streamlined architecture. It processes documents from Google Drive, performs a 3-level hierarchical web search using the Tavily API to gather 24 sources, and delivers a Slack-based summary with a PROCEED/PASS recommendation. Despite a 77% reduction in API calls compared to multi-agent competitors, the platform's output is rated as surface-level (6/10 user satisfaction) and often "doesn't add value to a VC analyst". Key operational limitations include in-memory session management that loses context between commands and an inefficient dual-process architecture for generating Slack summaries and full reports.

#### **The Problem**
The core problem is that the platform's intelligence capabilities do not meet the standards of professional venture capital due diligence. This manifests in several critical gaps:
1.  **Lack of Analytical Depth**: The current single-pass synthesis provides generic insights rather than the deep, verifiable analysis required for high-stakes investment decisions.
2.  **Static Intelligence**: The generated reports are static "snapshots." They cannot be queried, updated, or cross-referenced, failing to become a "living" part of the deal evaluation process.
3.  **No Claims Verification**: The system cannot automatically validate a startup's claims (e.g., market size, competitive differentiation) against the independently gathered market intelligence, a crucial step in professional due diligence.
4.  **Architectural Inefficiency**: The dual-pipeline process for generating Slack and Markdown outputs is redundant, costly, and can lead to inconsistencies between the summary and the full report.
5.  **Poor User Experience**: The lack of session persistence forces users to restart the analysis flow frequently, creating a fragmented and frustrating workflow.

#### **Impact**
These deficiencies severely limit the platform's value and market potential. The low-depth analysis undermines user trust and credibility, leading to poor user satisfaction (6/10) and positioning the tool as a novelty rather than an essential part of the VC tech stack. The inability to perform critical functions like claims verification means analysts must still perform significant manual work, defeating the platform's primary value proposition. This restricts the addressable market to less sophisticated investors and exposes the platform to competitive threats from both established players adding AI and new AI-native startups.

## 3. Proposed Enhancement

#### **Core Concept**
The proposed enhancement will evolve DataRoom Intelligence from a basic analysis tool into a professional-grade, independent market intelligence platform. The central innovation is the adoption of a **Single Process Architecture**. Instead of running separate, inefficient processes for Slack and full reports, the system will execute one comprehensive, deep analysis using the BMAD framework to generate a 15-20 page professional report. A high-fidelity, intelligent summary for Slack will then be derived from this complete report, ensuring perfect coherence and eliminating redundant API calls. This allows the platform to deliver consultant-level analysis focused on the market's potential, independent of the startup's own documentation quality.

#### **Key Features & Capabilities**
1.  **Post-Analysis Intelligence Suite**: A new set of Slack commands will transform static reports into dynamic, "living" intelligence assets.
    * **`/verify`**: Automatically compares claims made in a startup's dataroom against the independently generated market intelligence report to flag discrepancies and exaggerations.
    * **`/ask-reports`**: Allows users to ask natural language questions about any report generated within the session, enabling continuous, interactive due diligence.
    * **`/search`**: Provides ad-hoc, real-time web intelligence with a synthesized summary without needing to run a full analysis.
    * **`/memo`**: Generates a standardized, investment committee-ready memo by consolidating all gathered intelligence.
2.  **BMAD Framework Integration**: The analysis engine will be upgraded to use the BMAD methodology for deeper, more structured insights.
    * **Adaptive Research Types**: The system will dynamically select from 8 different research personas and frameworks based on the startup's stage and market context.
    * **Structured Prompting**: Analysis will be guided by expert-level, structured prompts to ensure professional quality and depth.
3.  **Critical Infrastructure Upgrades**: The platform's foundation will be enhanced for reliability and user experience.
    * **Session Persistence**: User sessions will be moved from volatile in-memory storage to a Redis-backed system, maintaining context across commands and over time (24-hour TTL).
    * **Intelligent Caching**: A multi-tier caching system will be implemented for search results and competitor data to reduce API costs by an estimated 40-50%.
    * **Quality Gates System**: An automated validation layer will ensure all analysis outputs meet minimum quality thresholds before being delivered to the user.

#### **Targeted Outcomes**
* **Improved Output Quality**: Increase user satisfaction with analysis depth and value from 6/10 to a target of 8.5/10.
* **Increased Analytical Depth**: Elevate reports from 3-4 basic insights to 8-10 actionable, consultant-level insights per analysis.
* **Enhanced User Efficiency**: Reduce the need for manual claims verification and follow-up research by up to 70% with the new `/verify` and `/ask-reports` commands.
* **Superior User Experience**: Achieve a 95% session restoration rate, eliminating the frustration of lost context between commands.
* **Greater Credibility**: Establish the platform as an essential, high-trust tool for professional VC due diligence through verifiable, in-depth, and interactive intelligence.

## 10. Risks and Mitigation

#### **10.1 Technical Risks**
* **Risk**: The core architectural refactor could lead to delays and introduce new bugs.
    * **Mitigation**: A phased rollout using feature flags will be employed, along with comprehensive regression testing before deprecating the old pipeline.
* **Risk**: Introducing new dependencies (Redis, PostgreSQL) adds operational complexity.
    * **Mitigation**: Infrastructure will be managed via IaC, with robust monitoring, alerting, and load testing implemented before production.

#### **10.2 Product Risks**
* **Risk**: "Living intelligence" features (`/ask-reports`, `/verify`) may not achieve the required accuracy to be trustworthy.
    * **Mitigation**: Launch features in a closed beta to gather feedback and refine accuracy. Clearly communicate confidence levels and cite sources to manage user expectations.
* **Risk**: Automated Quality Gates could be improperly calibrated.
    * **Mitigation**: Initially launch in a "logging-only" mode to calibrate thresholds on real-world data without impacting users.

#### **10.3 Market Risks**
* **Risk**: Competitors may release similar AI features faster, neutralizing our advantage.
    * **Mitigation**: Prioritize and accelerate the development of unique, defensible features like `/verify`. Focus go-to-market messaging on our superior cost-efficiency and claims verification capabilities.
