# Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy

## 1. Target Audience & Personas

### 1.1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Our target customers are **small to medium-sized Venture Capital firms** (e.g., 2-25 investment professionals) and other early-stage investment groups (e.g., Corporate VCs, Family Offices) that are technology-forward and operate in a high-deal-flow environment. These firms are actively seeking a competitive edge and recognize that manual due diligence is a key bottleneck in their investment process.

### 1.2. Primary User Persona: The Analyst

*   **Name:** Alex
*   **Role:** Analyst or Associate at a VC Firm.
*   **Responsibilities:** Sourcing new deals, performing initial screening of hundreds of companies, and conducting deep-dive due diligence on the most promising 5-10 startups each quarter.
*   **Pains & Frustrations:**
    *   Spends the vast majority of their week on tedious, manual data extraction from dataroom documents.
    *   Constantly fears that they might miss a critical red flag or a key metric buried in a 100-page appendix.
    *   Is under immense pressure from partners to process more deals faster without sacrificing quality.
*   **Goals & Desires:**
    *   To spend less time on data entry and more time on high-value strategic thinking.
    *   To present data to the investment committee with a high degree of confidence.
    *   To find the "hidden gems" and "red flags" that others might miss, making them more valuable to the firm.

## 4. Sales & Distribution Channels

### 4.1. Channel 1: Product-Led Growth (PLG)

*   **Strategy:** The "Free Tier" is the engine of our PLG strategy. We will make it incredibly easy for individual analysts (our "Alex" persona) to discover the tool and start using it for free without needing to speak to a salesperson.
*   **Goal:** To get the product into the hands of end-users and let its value spread organically within a firm. When multiple analysts at the same VC firm are using and loving the free product, it creates a powerful internal driver to upgrade to the "Team Tier."

### 4.2. Channel 2: Direct Outreach

*   **Strategy:** We will build a target list of our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) firms and engage in proactive, high-value outreach to Partners and Principals. This is a top-down sales motion that complements the bottom-up PLG approach.
*   **Goal:** To sell "Team Tier" and "Enterprise Tier" packages directly by demonstrating the clear ROI in terms of saved analyst time and improved decision-making quality.

### 4.3. Channel 3: Content & Community Marketing

*   **Strategy:** We will establish ourselves as thought leaders in the "VC Tech" space by creating content that our "Alex" persona finds genuinely useful. This includes blog posts, Twitter threads analyzing public filings, and participating in relevant online communities (e.g., VC-focused forums, subreddits).
*   **Goal:** To build brand awareness, drive organic traffic, and fuel the top of the funnel for our PLG strategy.
