- [ ] WHEN analysis completes
- [ ] THEN user receives note about processing method
- [ ] AND understands data quality may be reduced from OCR

**AC3: Performance Monitoring**
- [ ] GIVEN both GPT-4o and OCR processing attempts
- [ ] WHEN analysis completes
- [ ] THEN system logs processing method, success rate, and quality metrics
- [ ] AND provides data for system optimization

**Story Points**: 3  
**Dependencies**: G4O-001, existing OCR pipeline  
**Definition of Done**: System never fails analysis due to GPT-4o issues
