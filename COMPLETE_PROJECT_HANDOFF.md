## 🎯 DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY & WORKFLOW

### BRANCH STRATEGY
- **`main`**: Production branch → Railway auto-deployment
- **`phase2a-market-research`**: Current development branch
- **Merge Strategy**: Only merge to main after complete testing and approval

### DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
1. **Incremental Changes**: Small commits, test each change
2. **OK Confirmation**: Developer waits for Rafael's approval before proceeding
3. **Local Testing**: Test locally before any production merge
4. **Fallback Safety**: Always maintain working MVP on main branch

### COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- Rafael (Product Owner): Testing, prioritization, Railway deployments
- Claude (AI Developer): Implementation, architecture, incremental development
- Method: VS Code + GitHub + local testing, then production merge

## 💡 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS & NON-CRITICAL ENHANCEMENTS

> **Note:** This section tracks improvement ideas that are not currently prioritized but should be considered for future development cycles.

### 🔄 SYSTEM RELIABILITY & PERSISTENCE
**Persistent Document Storage (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Currently, document analysis sessions are lost on app restart/redeploy
- **Current State:** Documents stored in `user_sessions` (in-memory dictionary)
- **Impact:** Users need to re-run `/analyze` after system restarts
- **Proposed Solution:** Implement persistent storage (Redis, PostgreSQL, or file-based storage)
- **Implementation Approach:**
  ```python
  # Future: Replace in-memory sessions with persistent storage
  # Current: user_sessions = {}  # In-memory
  # Future: PersistentSessionManager with Redis/DB backend
  ```
- **Priority:** Medium - Quality of life improvement
- **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks (database integration + migration)

### 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
**Analysis Caching (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Duplicate analyses of same document sets require full reprocessing
- **Proposed Solution:** Document fingerprint-based caching system
- **Benefit:** Faster subsequent analyses of similar documents
- **Priority:** Low - Performance optimization

**Parallel Document Processing (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Large document sets process sequentially
- **Proposed Solution:** Parallel processing for document extraction
- **Benefit:** Reduced analysis time for large data rooms
- **Priority:** Low - Performance optimization

### 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS
**Cross-Channel Session Access (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Analysis sessions are channel-specific
- **Proposed Solution:** User-based sessions accessible across channels
- **Benefit:** Improved team collaboration workflows
- **Priority:** Low - UX improvement

**Analysis History & Comparison (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** No historical analysis tracking or comparison features
- **Proposed Solution:** Analysis history with diff/comparison capabilities
- **Benefit:** Track changes in startup documents over time
- **Priority:** Low - Advanced feature

### 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT & MAINTENANCE
**Error Handling Standardization (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across modules
- **Proposed Solution:** Standardized error handling framework
- **Priority:** Low - Code quality improvement

**Logging & Monitoring Enhancement (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Limited structured logging for debugging
- **Proposed Solution:** Enhanced logging with structured data and monitoring dashboards
- **Priority:** Low - Operational improvement

### 📋 FEATURE REQUESTS BACKLOG
**Custom Analysis Templates (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** One-size-fits-all analysis approach
- **Proposed Solution:** Customizable analysis templates per industry/stage
- **Priority:** Low - Advanced feature

**Webhook Integration (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** No external system integration capabilities
- **Proposed Solution:** Webhook system for analysis completion notifications
- **Priority:** Low - Integration feature
