## 💡 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS & NON-CRITICAL ENHANCEMENTS

> **Note:** This section tracks improvement ideas that are not currently prioritized but should be considered for future development cycles.

### 🔄 SYSTEM RELIABILITY & PERSISTENCE
**Persistent Document Storage (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Currently, document analysis sessions are lost on app restart/redeploy
- **Current State:** Documents stored in `user_sessions` (in-memory dictionary)
- **Impact:** Users need to re-run `/analyze` after system restarts
- **Proposed Solution:** Implement persistent storage (Redis, PostgreSQL, or file-based storage)
- **Priority:** Medium - Quality of life improvement
- **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks (database integration + migration)

### 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
**Analysis Caching (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Duplicate analyses of same document sets require full reprocessing
- **Proposed Solution:** Document fingerprint-based caching system
- **Benefit:** Faster subsequent analyses of similar documents
- **Priority:** Low - Performance optimization

**Parallel Document Processing (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Large document sets process sequentially
- **Proposed Solution:** Parallel processing for document extraction
- **Benefit:** Reduced analysis time for large data rooms
- **Priority:** Low - Performance optimization

### 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS
**Enhanced Output Formatting (High Priority for Week 1.2)**
- **Issue:** Market research output could be more visually appealing
- **Proposed Solution:** Better formatting, structured presentation, visual elements
- **Benefit:** More professional and readable market research reports
- **Priority:** High - Week 1.2 priority

**Cross-Channel Session Access (Non-Critical)**
- **Issue:** Analysis sessions are channel-specific
- **Proposed Solution:** User-based sessions accessible across channels
- **Benefit:** Improved team collaboration workflows
- **Priority:** Low - UX improvement
