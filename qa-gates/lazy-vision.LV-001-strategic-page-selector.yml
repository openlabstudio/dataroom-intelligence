# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)

story_id: LV-001
story_title: "Strategic Page Selector - Content Analysis Engine"
epic: "Lazy Vision Document Analysis Enhancement"

reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)"

# QUALITY GATE DECISION
gate_decision: "PASS_WITH_MINOR_CONCERNS"
release_approved: true
merge_approved: true

# DECISION RATIONALE
rationale: |
  Story LV-001 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive test coverage 
  and robust error handling. The core functionality meets all acceptance criteria with 
  production-ready resilience patterns. Minor concerns are architectural enhancements 
  rather than blocking issues.
