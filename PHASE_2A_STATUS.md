## 🛠 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **Branch Strategy**
- **Production**: `main` branch → Railway auto-deployment
- **Development**: `phase2a-market-research` branch → Safe testing
- **Merge Strategy**: Only merge to `main` after full testing

### **Testing Approach**
1. **Local Development**: Test new features locally before deployment
2. **Incremental Changes**: Small commits, test each change
3. **Fallback Safety**: Always maintain working MVP on `main`

### **Key Commands Added**
```bash
# New Slack command implemented
/market-research  # Comprehensive market intelligence analysis

# Enhanced existing commands
/analyze         # Now mentions market research option
@bot mentions    # Shows market research availability
```

---

## 🔧 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openlabstudio/dataroom-intelligence.git
cd dataroom-intelligence
git checkout phase2a-market-research
```

### **Environment Variables** (`.env` file)
```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...  
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS=path/to/credentials.json
```

### **Installation & Running**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### **Expected Behavior**
- Local bot connects to Slack
- `/market-research` command available
- Market detection analyzes documents and provides critical assessment
- Progress updates in Spanish as specified

## 📞 DEVELOPMENT TEAM CONTEXT

### **Roles**
- **Rafael (Product Owner)**: Feature prioritization, testing, Railway deployments
- **Claude (AI Developer)**: Code implementation, architecture, incremental development

### **Communication Protocol**
- **Small incremental changes**: Each change committed separately for easy testing
- **OK confirmation**: Developer waits for Rafael's OK before proceeding
- **Branch-based development**: Never break `main` branch
- **Real-time testing**: Rafael tests locally after each significant change

### **Repository Access**
- **GitHub**: `openlabstudio/dataroom-intelligence`
- **Claude MCP Access**: Full repository read/write via GitHub API
- **Deployment**: Railway auto-deploys from `main` branch

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING & TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues**
- **Import Errors**: Check if new agent modules are properly imported
- **OpenAI API**: Market research requires OpenAI configuration
- **Session Management**: Market research results stored in `user_sessions[user_id]['market_research']`

### **Key Files Modified**
- `app.py`: Added `/market-research` command and progress functions
- `agents/`: Complete new directory with multi-agent system
- All existing handlers: Unchanged (maintain backward compatibility)

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] `/analyze` still works (core MVP functionality)
- [ ] `/market-research` runs without errors
- [ ] Progress updates display correctly in Slack
- [ ] Market detection returns valid results
- [ ] Critical assessment generates meaningful insights
- [ ] Results stored in user session
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing commands
