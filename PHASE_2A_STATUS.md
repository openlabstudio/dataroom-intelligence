## 🛠 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **Branch Strategy**
- **Production**: `main` branch → Railway auto-deployment
- **Development**: `phase2a-market-research` branch → Safe testing
- **Merge Strategy**: Only merge to `main` after full testing

### **Testing Approach**
1. **Local Development**: Test new features locally before deployment
2. **Incremental Changes**: Small commits, test each change
3. **Fallback Safety**: Always maintain working MVP on `main`

### **Key Commands Added**
```bash
# New Slack command implemented
/market-research  # Comprehensive market intelligence analysis

# Enhanced existing commands
/analyze         # Now mentions market research option
@bot mentions    # Shows market research availability
```

---

## 🔧 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openlabstudio/dataroom-intelligence.git
cd dataroom-intelligence
git checkout phase2a-market-research
```

### **Environment Variables** (`.env` file)
```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS=path/to/credentials.json
```

### **Installation & Running**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### **Expected Behavior**
- Local bot connects to Slack
- `/market-research` command available
- Market detection analyzes documents and provides critical assessment
- Progress updates in Spanish as specified

---

## 📋 HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS STATUS

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **What Works (Don't Break)**
- ✅ All existing MVP commands (`/analyze`, `/ask`, `/scoring`, `/memo`, `/gaps`, `/reset`, `/health`)
- ✅ Google Drive integration and document processing
- ✅ Railway deployment from `main` branch
- ✅ User session management
- ✅ Multi-threading for background processing

# 🚀 PHASE 2A: MARKET RESEARCH AGENT - UPDATED STATUS

**Repository:** `openlabstudio/dataroom-intelligence`
**Working Branch:** `phase2a-market-research`
**Main Branch (Production):** `main` (Railway auto-deploys from here)
**Current Date:** August 7, 2025
**Development Phase:** STABLE - Compact Formatting Complete + Chain of Thought Planning

---

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED - COMPACT FORMATTING COMPLETE

### **✅ STABLE VERSION COMMITTED**
- **Commit SHA:** [Latest commit with compact formatting - see git log]
- **Commit Message:** "🎉 STABLE: Market research with improved compact formatting + TEST MODE"
- **Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY - All functionality working correctly
- **Key Achievement:** Slack character limit problem SOLVED

### **✅ COMPACT FORMATTING SUCCESS**
**Problem SOLVED:** Slack character limit (~4000 chars) prevented detailed market research output

**Solution IMPLEMENTED:** Compact main response format
- **Before:** ~4000+ characters, hit Slack limits, poor UX
- **After:** ~800 characters, clean formatting, essential info visible
- **Format:** English throughout for consistency
- **Structure:** Market Profile + Critical Assessment + Available Commands

**Example Output:**
```
✅ MARKET RESEARCH COMPLETED

🎯 MARKET PROFILE
📊 Clarity: 9/10 | Consistency: 9/10 | Specificity: 9/10 | Data Quality: 8/10
• Vertical: cleantech/water treatment
• Target: B2B, specifically pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries...
• Geo: Europe, expanding to North America...
• Model: Direct-to-Business, Technology Licensing...

🔍 CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:
⚠️ The startup's claim of TAM €1.6B seems optimistic but not unreasonable for the water treatment sector. However, the path from €40M SOM to €15M revenue in 5 years requires aggressive market penetration...
💡 No mention of major competitors like Veolia, Suez, or emerging cleantech players. The 60% energy reduction claim needs independent validation...

📋 AVAILABLE COMMANDS:
• /market-critical - Detailed evaluation
• /market-full - Complete PDF report
• /ask [question] - Specific queries
• /scoring - Detailed scoring
```

## 🧪 TEST MODE IMPLEMENTED FOR EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT

### **✅ COST-EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**
**Problem:** GPT-4 API calls expensive during iterative development
**Solution:** TEST_MODE environment variable

**Implementation:**
```bash
# .env file
TEST_MODE=true
```

**Behavior in Test Mode:**
- ✅ `/analyze` - Processes documents, NO GPT-4 call, creates valid session
- ✅ `/market-research` - Instant response with realistic mock data, NO GPT-4 call
- ✅ **Cost:** $0 during development
- ✅ **Speed:** Instant responses for rapid iteration
- ✅ **Functionality:** Full session management and command testing

**Production Mode:**
```bash
TEST_MODE=false  # or remove from .env
```
- Full GPT-4 analysis with real data
- Normal API costs (~$0.50 per analysis)

## 📞 DEVELOPMENT TEAM CONTEXT

### **Roles**
- **Rafael (Product Owner)**: Feature prioritization, testing, Railway deployments
- **Claude (AI Developer)**: Code implementation, architecture, incremental development

### **Communication Protocol**
- **Small incremental changes**: Each change committed separately for easy testing
- **OK confirmation**: Developer waits for Rafael's OK before proceeding
- **Branch-based development**: Never break `main` branch
- **Real-time testing**: Rafael tests locally after each significant change

### **Repository Access**
- **GitHub**: `openlabstudio/dataroom-intelligence`
- **Claude MCP Access**: Full repository read/write via GitHub API
- **Deployment**: Railway auto-deploys from `main` branch

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING & TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues**
- **Import Errors**: Check if new agent modules are properly imported
- **OpenAI API**: Market research requires OpenAI configuration
- **Session Management**: Market research results stored in `user_sessions[user_id]['market_research']`

### **Key Files Modified**
- `app.py`: Added `/market-research` command and progress functions
- `agents/`: Complete new directory with multi-agent system
- All existing handlers: Unchanged (maintain backward compatibility)
